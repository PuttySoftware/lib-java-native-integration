# lib-java-native-integration

Java class library providing operating system integration for Swing programs.

Requires Java SE 10 or later (subject to change as newer Java major versions are released).

This was made with Eclipse, and is thus structured as an Eclipse project. There is only one source file and one package, so migrating it to another IDE is simple.
