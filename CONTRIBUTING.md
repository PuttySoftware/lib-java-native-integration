:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

I'm really glad you're reading this, because the need for volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition is always there.

#### **Did you find a bug, intend to add a new feature, or change an existing feature?**

* **Ensure the bug or feature was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/wrldwzrd89/lib-java-native-integration/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/wrldwzrd89/lib-java-native-integration/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring / the new functionality to be added / the existing functionality to be changed.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug or satisfies a feature request?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

Thanks,

Eric Ahnell (wrldwzrd89), project owner
